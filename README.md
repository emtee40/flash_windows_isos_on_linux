# flash_windows_isos_on_linux
Create bootable Windows USBs using the UEFI:NTFS bootloader created by pbatard.

This is an alpha release. Expect a lot of bugs!

Tested with win 11 and win10 official ISOs.

It works.

Need to fix :

      - The unmount process requires some time.
      - It requires at least a 16gb usb.
